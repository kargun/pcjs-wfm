# 'site.pcjs.unbundled' is now preferred when 'site.developer' is true, and it takes precedence in our
# Jekyll scripts over 'site.pcjs.uncompiled'; unbundled means JavaScript modules are loaded individually
# as-is, whereas uncompiled means all the modules are concatenated into a single script with all module
# imports/exports stripped out.
#
# We had to use uncompiled scripts before JavaScript module support was fully baked, and there were
# restrictions (eg, only one type of machine could be loaded on a single page).  Those restrictions are
# gone now, so of the three server modes (compiled, uncompiled, and unbundled), compiled is preferred
# for production servers and unbundled is preferred for development servers.
#
# Uncompiled scripts haven't gone away, however.  XSL-rendered XML machines still don't support the use
# of unbundled modules (yet), and since the server does not offer any means of controlling XSL rendering (yet),
# the <machine> tag of each XML file must set 'uncompiled' to "true" in order to use uncompiled scripts.
#
# 'site.pcjs.localdisks' can be turned if on you have local copies of PCjs disk images; be sure to also
# remove '/disks' from the "exclude" section below, and change `softwareLocal` to 'software'.
#
# See https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/wiki/Using-a-Local-Web-Server#accessing-disk-images-locally for more
# information.
